' JagStudio assets file.
'
' This is where we tell JagStudio to load in our graphics and sounds etc.
'
' Firstly, all these lines are comments and are not useful to the build process.
' To be exact, all lines starting with the characters ";", "#", "'", "*" are considered to be comments.
' 
' Each non-comment assets.txt line is considered to have 4 comma separated strings of text like the following:
' A,B,C,D
' | | | +-- Filename of the asset, relative to the project folder (i.e. assets\gfx\background.bmp)
' | | +---- Tells the build process if the file should just be imported as is or some conversion is needed beforehand. See below for details.
' | +------ Name asset which is exposed to JagStudio. Actually two variables are exposed to JagStudio: name and name_end which holds the start and end addresses of the asset.
' |         Names may start with an uppercase or lowercase letter (A-Z a-z), an underscore (_), a question mark (?) or a period (.).
' +-------- This should either be ABS or ROM. This tells the build process if you want the asset to be included in RAM or ROM.
'
' Parameter C explained further:
' - This can be any text if you have some asset that you want imported in JagStudio as is (for example a converted raw sample or a backdrop). For this you can put any text in C.
' - For graphics conversion you can use "gfx_clut" or "gfx_noclut" to convert a .BMP file into jaguar raw format and optionally export the paletter or not (clut=yes, noclut=no).
'   This applies to 1-, 2-, 4- and 8-bit graphics only.
'   For 16-bit and 24-bit graphics no clut is created (because there isn't a need for one).
'   Finally for 16-bit images you have to use gfx_clut16 or gfx_noclut16.
' - For conversion to CRY mode use "gfx_cry".
' - For audio files you can use "sfx_rawXXXXX" to convert any audio file (for example .wav, .mp3, .ogg, etc) into raw format.
'   You can optionally set XXXXX to be the desired sample rate, otherwise 8000Hz is used by default.
' - If you want the audio files to be compressed using u-law then use "sfx_mlawXXXX" instead (note - this requires Zerosquare's player!)
' - Rmotion scripts should be placed here, use "rmotion".
' - Finally, if you want an asset packed, append a "_pack" suffix. For example "gfx_noclut_pack". 
'   Note that rmotion scripts and CLUTs aren't packed for now.
'   Also note that it's your responsibility to reserve RAM for unpacking as well as running jsfUnpack to unpack the asset.
'
